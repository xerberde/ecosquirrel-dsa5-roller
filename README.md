# DSA5 Dice Roller for Foundry VTT 11

The module adds FoundryVTT functions to simple dice roll, adapted for the game Das schwarze Auge / The Dark Eye.

Just another Dice Roller.

Was intended as a small project to see if I can do it, as so often with small things it becomes bigger than you think
and lasts longer than you wanted and learns more than you thought. That's exactly why I love small projects like this.
<br>
And yes, there are already so many "Dice Roller" at the market, no matter I had fun creating them. Learned something new!!!

I try to keep it up to date, but it's just a hobby....

### How to use

After installation a new button is added to the left bar. When activated a popup will be displayed.

![demo_popup](https://github.com/xerberde/xerbers-dsa5-roller/blob/main/images/demo_popup.png)

From here you can roll a 1D6, 2D6, 3D6 or 1D20 with or without bonus points as well, when activated a Coin flip, LeP, AsP, KaP roll.

* Mouse left click on &plusmn; in the popup performs a throw with positive bonus.
* Mouse right click on &plusmn; in the popup performs a roll with negative bonus.


### Settings

* Enable/Disable each dice row in settings dialog to show or not show in popup
* Change LeP regeneration dice roll form 1D6 to 1D3
